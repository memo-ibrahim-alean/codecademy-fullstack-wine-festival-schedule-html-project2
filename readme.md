# Wine Festival Schedule

## Overview:
This project, part of the Full-Stack Engineer Path on Codecademy, In this project, I’m going to practice tabular organization in HTML so I can hone my skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? If I’m going to have data on a webpage, I’ve got to master the skill of effectively and aesthetically organizing it – an HTML table is the perfect solution.

## Key Features:
- Ensure a well-organized table structure using HTML tags. Utilize `<table>` to define the table, `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for header cells, and <td> for data cells. Proper nesting and arrangement of these tags contribute to a clear and structured table layout.
- Employ semantic HTML elements for better document structure. Use `<thead>` for the table header, `<tbody>` for the table body, and `<tfoot>` for the table footer if applicable. This enhances the readability of your HTML code and helps in understanding the purpose of different sections within the table.
- Application of semantic HTML for improved document structure.
- Ensure my HTML table is accessible by using attributes like scope in `<th>` elements to associate them with rows or columns. Add appropriate text content, such as headings and captions, to make the table understandable for users with screen readers or other assistive technologies.
